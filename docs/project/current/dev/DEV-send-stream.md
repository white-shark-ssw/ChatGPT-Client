# DEV-send-stream

## Status

**Active — exact b90 auth/list prerequisite recovered and frontmost presentation itself is Runtime Positive, but the latest project-conversation evidence exposes a stronger code-level blocker: the covered-Web bridge recognizes only `/c/{conversation}` and loses the target conversation after official project canonicalization to `/g/{scope}/c/{conversation}`. b91 is allocated as the minimum project-scoped route-parser A/B. Stable/Frozen Send remains No.**

## b89 Runtime conclusion

Exact b89 on iPhone/iOS17 proved `isUserInteractionEnabled=true` and first-responder/document focus, yet emitted zero page-owned continuation while the same remote response later advanced only after explicit Sync from timeline `5 -> 28`, tools `4 -> 25`, reasoning `1 -> 3`. Therefore interactivity is rejected as a sufficient continuation condition. Manual authoritative Detail projection remains Runtime Positive.

## b90 Runtime progression

The earlier Native auth `NSURLErrorDomain -1005` sample was transient/inconclusive. Later exact b90 Runtime restored `/api/auth/session`, accounts-check and conversation-list HTTP200; manual Sync then raised the executor from `visibleSiblingCountAbove=1` to `0`, loaded a visible complete page, and achieved `nativeFirstResponder=true` / `documentHasFocus=true`. Therefore the b90 frontmost mechanism itself is Runtime Positive.

That sample still showed no bridge-reported matching `stream_status`, `/resume`, external streaming or project snapshot. This absence is no longer valid evidence against official project-Web continuation because a stronger bridge identity defect is now proven below.

## Project-scoped route-parser root cause — 2026-09-03

User Runtime observation: ordinary non-project conversations do not show the same continuation failure, while the current project conversation does; visible official Web itself appears healthy.

Current source directly explains this split:

- every existing conversation is initially loaded through `https://chatgpt.com/c/{conversationID}`;
- bridge `currentConversationID()` matches only `^/c/([^/?#]+)`;
- known official project canonical form is `/g/{scope}/c/{conversation}`;
- after canonicalization, the current bridge therefore returns `null` for a valid project conversation and classifies that page as `route=other`;
- the bridge uses that parsed `pageConversationID` as a required equality gate for page-owned `stream_status`, `/resume`, plural conversation snapshots, WebSocket exact-target matching and composer conversation identity;
- consequently, correct official project-Web requests can occur while the Native bridge silently treats them as non-target and emits none of the expected external continuation events.

The latest b90 log is consistent with this exact transition: immediately after direct `/c/{id}` reload page diagnostics report `route=conversation`, while later page activation events report `route=other` although the visible official Web remains healthy.

Qualification: **project scoped-route identity parsing is now the strongest evidenced blocker. The b90 no-event interval cannot decide z-order sufficiency for project conversations because the observer can become blind after project canonicalization.**

## b91 exact minimum A/B

Allocate b91 only for the bridge identity parser:

- preserve b90 transport, protected Send ownership, Repository ownership, observation protocol and diagnostic frontmost behavior for causal isolation;
- change `currentConversationID()` so it recognizes both ordinary `/c/{conversation}` and exact evidenced project scoped `/g/{scope}/c/{conversation}`;
- `pageRouteShape`, stream-status matching, resume matching, plural snapshot matching, WebSocket target matching and composer conversation identity then automatically consume the corrected identity through their existing shared helper;
- do not add new route guesses, retry/fallback/timer/watchdog/polling, Native status/resume synthesis, duplicate Send, WebSocket-body authority or second response store.

## b91 Human Runtime gate

After b91 package verification, run the same project-conversation test while a remote response is clearly active. Decisive evidence is no longer z-order itself; it is whether, after project canonicalization, the bridge continues to identify the target and reports the official page-owned path:

- page remains classified as conversation after scoped canonicalization;
- matching `coveredExecutor.externalStreamStatusRequest/Response` and/or `externalResumeRequest/Response` appears when official Web issues them;
- `externalStreamingObserved` / page-owned snapshot can advance the existing Repository external generation without another manual Sync.

If b91 makes project continuation observable/functional, route parsing is Runtime Positive; then a later separate candidate may remove the b90 frontmost diagnostic to prove the final covered production form. If b91 still has no page-owned requests while the project page is correctly recognized and the remote response demonstrably advances, continue from that new evidence without speculative protocol work.

## Validation / identity state

b90 package remains exact and unchanged: canonical Artifact `9882770072`, exact package source `99f1aa15...`, IPA SHA `e75fac1a0c935ddb577fe2361c3fc5add0164d2f555a4fe5e8d7975f5b9fe3ee`.

b91 identity guard is clean at allocation: repository commit search found no b91 identity, branch search found no b91 branch collision, and actual `main` remains `94f0c5777dad262cd1fb22be49082dbd92c962f2`.

## Batch recovery state

**Open for b91 route-parser implementation/package. Next exact action:** apply only the evidenced scoped-route parser correction plus Build/Candidate 91, run guarded CI/package verification, then stop at Human Runtime.

## Preserved boundaries

Official page owns continuation transport; `ConversationRepository` owns Native response/content. No Native `stream_status`, `/resume`, guessed offset, polling/cadence reproduction, retry/watchdog, duplicate Send, WebSocket-body authority, hidden-thought presentation or second response store.

## Session round counter

This user turn is **round 59**.
